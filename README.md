# Clock Math Game

A simple browser-based game that turns modular arithmetic into something visual and fun.  
Built in **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no setup, just a file you can open in your browser.

## How It Works
- The game shows a clock face with numbers 1–12.
- A question appears:  
  *“It’s 3:00. What time will it be in 5 hours?”*
- Click the number on the clock where you think the hand should land.
- If you’re right ✅ the hour hand sweeps clockwise to the correct time.  
- If you’re wrong ❌ the hand still moves clockwise to your choice, and you can try again.  
- Buttons:  
  - **New Question** → generate a fresh problem.  
  - **Reset** → put the hand back to the start hour to try again.

## Quick Start
1. Download or clone this repo.  
2. Open `clockMath.html` in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all work).  
3. Start clicking on the clock to answer!

No installs, no build step — it’s pure front-end.
